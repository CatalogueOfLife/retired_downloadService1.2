This document explains how to install the webservice for the Download Service 1.2.
In order to work, you will need a working version of the DCA exporter.
You will need to setup a database, this is only for the storage of the key.
If you already got a database for key storage, you could use that one.

1) Export from svn.
Receive the application by exporting it from svn, this can be done by the following location:
svn://dev.4d4life.eu/downloadService1.2/<version>
Please replace the version with the version you want to work with, this could be the trunk, a tag or a branch.
example: svn://dev.4d4life.eu/downloadService1.2/trunk

2) Import database structure
You will need a database to store your keys.
If the database is already present, skip this part.
Create a mysql database and import the database structure, this can be found in application/data/db/key_store.sql

3) Configuring the webservice
Copy or rename the file public/.htaccess.tpl to public/.htaccess
Change @BASE_URL@						to the base url or leave empty when no rewrite base is needed.

Copy or rename the file application/configs/application.xml.tpl to application/configs/application.xml
There are 8 variables that you need to change in this script.
line 20: @PATH_TO_AC_DCA_EXPORTER@		change this to the path where the DCA exporter lives, example "/var/www/DCAExporter".
line 21: @BASE_URL_TO_AC_DCA_EXPORTER@	change this to the url where the DCA exporter lives, example "http://dev.4d4life.eu/DCAExporter".
line 22: @PHP_LOCATION@					this is used to call php, normally "php" should be enough here. example "php".
line 23: @BASE_PATH@					change this to the base path. example "/var/www/DownloadService1.2".
The following database settings are only for the key database!
line 71: @DBHOST@						change this to the host address of the database, default is localhost, example "localhost".
line 72: @DBUSER@						change this to the username of the database, default is root, example "root".
line 73: @DBPASS@						change this to the password of the database, example "secret".
